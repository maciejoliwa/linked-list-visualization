## Linked List Implementation Visualization

Visualization of my implementation of a linked list in python. All left to implement is:
* Iteration,
* Clearing,
* Finding,
* Filtering,
* Mapping,
* Searching by index

Okay that seems like a lot of stuff to add

### How to use:
* Click with your mouse anywhere to add a point,
* Press any button on your keyboard to clear the screen

### Running:
Simply:
```python3 main.py``` or ```python main.py```, just make sure you have pygame installed
